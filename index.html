    <h2>Course Description </h2>
    An introduction to the design of data-intensive, reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.
    This may include concepts such as parallel programming, distributed computing, distributed file systems, MapReduce,
    regular expressions, and the ingesting and processing of data at-rest and data in motion.
    Tools used may include Hadoop, HDFS, Pig, Hive, Spark, Storm, Kafka, Mahout, MLlib, etc.

    <h2>Course Rationale</h2>
    This course involves an overview the design and implementation of data intensive systems covering common approaches
    to processing big data at rest and data in motion.

        and/or
        a failing the course with an academic integrity violation. </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Standard University -->

    <h2>Late Work Policy </h2>
    Graded activities are expected to be completed by due date. Late work is not
    accepted and may result in a 0 for the assignment.
    If you must miss an activity or a deadline, contact the instructor in advance.

    <h2>Submissions</h2>
    All submissions must be unique and creative. All submissions must be your
    own, creative, unique work.
    Students may be asked to explain their work during class, in discussions,
    or in a recorded submission.

    <h2> Grade of Incomplete (I)</h2>
    Following Northwest Missouri State University policy, incomplete grades may
    only be given in extreme circumstances, such as illness, death in a
    student's immediate family, or similar circumstances beyond a student's
    control, and the student was unable to complete a significant portion of the
    course work.

    <h2>Attendance </h2>
    Students are expected to attend all classes as specified in the course
    syllabi for each course.
    This course has many in-class activities, most of which have points and may
    not be announced in advance. Students arriving late or missing activities
    due to unexcused absences may not be able to make up work and may earn zero
    points for the activity.
    It is the responsibility of the student to promptly notify their instructor
